programs are as follow:
change_making_recursive_greedy
change_making_dynamic_greedy 
both programs work into Command Prompt by following command:
python program_name.py return change=n number of denominations=k k-size integer array=""
For Example:
python change_making_dynamic_greedy.py 120 4 "1 5 10 25"
which:
n=120
k=4
types of coins: penny=1, nicke=5, dime=10, and quarter=25
and output is like below:
Dynamic Programming Result:
[25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25]
Time taken (nanoseconds): 0.0010020732879638672

Greedy Algorithm Result:
[25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25]
Time taken (nanoseconds): 0.0

Output
The program outputs the following information:
The coins used to make change.
The time taken to compute the solution in nanoseconds.

Testing
The program has been tested on various test cases, including the US coin system and custom coin systems.
It has been verified for correctness and performance.
