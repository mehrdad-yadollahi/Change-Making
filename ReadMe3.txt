This program contains 2 parts as follow:
first part is Random Graph Generation.
second part is BFS and find-min-hop-path code.
by "running python file in terminal" you can see output as below:
Path from 19 to 11: [19, 20, 11]
Path from 8 to 13: [8, 11, 13]
Path from 6 to 19: [6, 41, 39, 38, 19]
Path from 20 to 41: [20, 11, 6, 41]

Path from 6 to 15: [6, 41, 39, 28, 15]
Path from 41 to 10: None
Path from 5 to 25: [5, 25]
Path from 44 to 9: [44, 9]

Graph with 50 nodes and 100 edges took on average 20828 nanoseconds per query

for each input graph type G1,G2,G3 and G4, it considers randomly 25 pairs and shows avarage time based on nanoseconds.
