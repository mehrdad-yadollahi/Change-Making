programs are as follow:
change_making_dynamic_greedy
program works into Command Prompt by following command:

python program_name.py return change=n number of denominations=k k-size integer array=""

For Example:
python change_making_dynamic_greedy.py 57 4 "1 5 10 25"
which:
n=57
k=4
types of coins: penny=1, nicke=5, dime=10, and quarter=25
and output is like below:

Dynamic Programming Solution:
Coins used: [1, 1, 5, 25, 25]
Number of coins: 5
Time taken: 0.0 nanoseconds

Greedy Solution:
Coins used: [25, 25, 5, 1, 1]
Number of coins: 5
Time taken: 0.0 nanoseconds

Output
The program outputs the following information:
The coins used to make change.
The Number of coins
The time taken to compute the solution in nanoseconds.

Testing
The program has been tested on various test cases, including the US coin system and custom coin systems.
It has been verified for correctness and performance.
